# Non-Gaussian Boson Sampling
This Python program allows you to study the interference patterns of a family of non-Gaussian states of light in arbitrary optical networks.

To Run: </br>

Set input states in the driver_code.py for just obtaining the probabilities and run: </br>
python driver_code.py </br>

In order to get correlation analysis results </br>
python photon_correlation.py </br>
