# Non-Gaussian Boson Sampling
This Python program allows you to study the interference patterns of a family of non-Gaussian states of light in arbitrary optical networks.

To Run: </br>

In order to just obtain the tabulated probabilities of output configuration, set input states in the file driver_code.py  </br>
python driver_code.py </br>

In order to get correlation analysis results as well as tabulated probabilities, set input states in the file and run: </br>
python photon_correlation.py </br>
